# Suicide Rate Visualization (2016)

In 2016 WHO recorded 786,047 cases of suicide across the globe. Among these cases, suicide is most prevalent in the age group 30-49. The age which people might experience mid life crisis, the hardships of raising family, and loss of someone special.

However, to speak numbers globally is too general and broad. Each country is different in its socioeconomic makeup. Presumably, living in a lower income country is harder as needs fulfillment are harder. We then hypothesize that there is a pattern to be found between suicide rate and country income.
